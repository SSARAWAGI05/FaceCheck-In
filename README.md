# FaceCheck In

## Problem Statement
Managing attendance manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Traditional methods such as roll calls and sign-in sheets lack efficiency, accuracy, and security. Additionally, preventing unauthorized access to restricted areas remains a challenge. Our solution, FaceCheck In, automates attendance tracking using AI-powered facial recognition, enhancing efficiency, security, and reliability.

## Solution: FaceCheck In
FaceCheck In is an AI-driven facial recognition system designed to automate attendance tracking and monitoring in organizations. It processes live video streams to detect and recognize faces, seamlessly marking attendance. Unrecognized individuals are flagged and stored separately for further review. The platform ensures accuracy, security, and a hassle-free attendance management experience.
